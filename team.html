      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Professor Tao Sun. Principal Investigator</h3>
	</div>
      <p style="text-align: center;" >Assistant Professor, Bioengineering Northeastern Univiersity</p>
      <p class="professor-details">Prof. Tao Sun is an Assistant Professor of Bioengineering and a core member of Institute of Chemical Imaging of Living Systems (CILS) 
        at Northeastern University. He joined Northeastern in January 2023 after postdoctoral trainings from Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and Harvard Engineering School 
        (Bioengineering), and an Instructor role with Harvard Medical School.
        His group works at the intersection of focused ultrasound (FUS), neuroimaging and immunoengineering with expertise in developing ultrasound devices, imaging methods 
        and engineered cell systems to modulate the neuro-immune interface and their applications in immunomodulation, drug delivery, and cell-based theranostic systems.</p> 
        
		  <p class="professor-details">The goal of his research program is to unveil how FUS modulates the neuroimmune disease/aging environment and to develop ultrasound-based 
        techniques for treating and monitoring neurological disorders, such as glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease, and beyond. 
        Tao has received many recognitions for his scientific contributions to the fields of FUS, drug delivery, cancer immunoengineering, and neuroimaging. He is a recipient of 
        the Young Investigator Awards from Focused Ultrasound Foundation and Acoustical Society of America. Many of his works were featured in mainstream science and technology 
        media including WIRED (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-second-coming-of-ultrasound/">https://www.wired.com/story/the-second-coming-of-ultrasound/</a>), Science Daily, 
        and Medical Xpress.

		     <p><b>Lab Contribution:</b> I am investigating the immunomodulatory effects of Focused ultrasound paired up with microbubbles to open the blood-brain barrier. I am 
          particularly interested in how this method influences the brain's immune cells, like macrophages and microglia, aiming to unlock the answers on the mechanism of how these 
          cellular machines can defect Glioblastoma. This approach bridges tissue engineering, neurology, and immunology, offering potential breakthroughs in combating brain cancer.</p>
